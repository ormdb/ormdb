### Definition

Tables must be defined before usage. Each table to be defined, is inherited from **`Odb.Table.Base`**. Column(s) of the table are the type of **`Odb.Table.Column`** while its' data-type is specified with a property.

If a column-type is often used in many of your tables, you can use a column as a reference.

Please refer to [Example Header](##OTH-Example-Header) for usage.

### Declaration
Instances of the tables are being initialized.

``````XXX
```C#
    private TableHeader h = new TableHeader();
    private TableLines  l = new TableLines();
```
```VB
    Private h As New TableHeader()
    Private l As New TableLines()
```
``````

<br/>

If you would like to join a table with itself, same table can be initialized twice as shown below.

``````XXX
```C#
    private TableHeader h  = new TableHeader();
    private TableLines  l  = new TableLines();
    private TableHeader h2 = new TableHeader();
```
```VB
    Private h  As New TableHeader()
    Private l  As New TableLines()
    Private h2 As New TableHeader()
```
``````
