Instance of a registered connection can be initialized with **`Create`** or **`CreateAndOpen`**.

<br/>

**Definition**
``````XXX
```C#
namespace Connection {
    public class Manager {

        public static Connection Create(string Id = DefaultRegisterID, 
                                        bool AutoStartTrans = false, 
                                        bool AutoConnect = true){}

        public static Connection CreateAndOpen(string Name = DefaultRegisterID, 
                                               bool AutoStartTrans = false){}
```
```VB
NameSpace Connection
    Public Class Manager

        Public Shared Function Create(Id As string = DefaultRegisterID, 
									  AutoStartTrans As Boolean= False, 
									  AutoConnect As Boolean = True) As Connection

        Public Shared Function CreateAndOpen(Name As String = DefaultRegisterID, 
											 AutoStartTrans As Boolean = False) As Connection
```

**Examples**


Following section demonstrates how to create a connection as **`ImmediatelyConnect`**.
``````XXX
```C#
// Connection is being initialized and opened immediately.
var cn = OrmDB.Connection.Manager.CreateAndOpen("MSSQL");
```
```VB
' Connection is being initialized and opened immediately.
Dim cn = OrmDB.Connection.Manager.CreateAndOpen("MSSQL")
```
``````

<br/>

Following section demonstrates how to create a connection as **`AutoConnection`**.
``````XXX
```C#
// Connection is being initialized.
var cn = OrmDB.Connection.Manager.Create("MSSQL");

// Connection is opened for first execution.
   ...
```
```VB
' Connection is being initialized.
Dim cn = OrmDB.Connection.Manager.Create("MSSQL")

' Connection is opened for first execution.
   ...
```
``````

<br/>

Following section demonstrates how to create a connection as **`AutoConnection`**.
``````XXX
```C#
// Connection is being initialized.
var cn = OrmDB.Connection.Manager.Create("MSSQL", AutoConnect:false);

// Connection is NOT opened for first execution; must be opened manually.
cn.Open();
```
```VB
' Connection is being initialized.
Dim cn = OrmDB.Connection.Manager.Create("MSSQL", AutoConnect:=false)

' Connection is NOT opened for first execution; must be opened manually.
cn.Open()
```
