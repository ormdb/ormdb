### Defining Provider

**`OrmDb`** uses a **Connection.Provider** shown below, to connect to a data source by supplying necessary authentication information in a **provider**. 

<br/>

| Provider     | | Factory                                            |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
|Odb.Connection.Provider.`MsSql`		|Microsoft SQL Server | System.Data.SqlClient|
|Odb.Connection.Provider.`MySql`		|MySQL / MariaDB | MySql.Data.MySqlClient	|
|Odb.Connection.Provider.`PostgreSql	`|PostgreSQL | Npgsql						|
|Odb.Connection.Provider.`Oracle`		|Oracle | Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.Client	|

<br/>

| Parameters     |Description                                                              |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Host			 |is `host-info` of the database-server to be connected.				   |
|Catalog		 |is `name` of the **database** (or **service** for Oracle) to be connected. |
|*User*          |Optional. is `user-name` to use when making the connection. is NOT necessary for **trusted-connection** |
|*Password*      |Optional. is `password` to use when making the connection. is NOT necessary for **trusted-connection** |
|*Port*          |Optional. is `port-info` of the database-server to be connected.         |
|*DBA_Privilege* |Optional. provides the connection with SYSDBA privileges. (for Oracle)   |


<br/>

Following section defines a provider.
``````XXX
```C#
var ms_db = new Odb.Connection.Provider.MsSql("host", "database-name", "user", "****");

// for trusted
var ms_db = new Odb.Connection.Provider.MsSql("host", "database-name");
```
```VB
Dim ms_db = New Odb.Connection.Provider.MsSql("host", "database-name", "user", "****")

' for trusted
Dim ms_db = new Odb.Connection.Provider.MsSql("host", "database-name")
```
``````

<br/>

### Creating Connection


<br/>

| Parameters        |Description                                                              |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|*AutoStartTrans*   |Optional. Every sql are executed in transaction as automatically. Transactions are initialized again automatically after COMMIT or ROLLBACK commands. |
|*AutoConnect*      |Optional. Connection is opened automatically on first sql execution.         |
|*SchemaPrefix*     |Optional. is used for making group the tables in database. If it is specified then the prefix appends for every tables before sql execution. |


<br/>

A connection can be created with **`Create`** or **`CreateAndOpen`** via **provider** already defined.

``````XXX
```C#
Connection CreateAndOpen(bool AutoStartTrans = false)

Connection Create(bool AutoStartTrans = false, bool AutoConnect = true)
```
```VB
CreateAndOpen(Optional AutoStartTrans As Boolean = False) As Connection

Create(Optional AutoStartTrans As Boolean = False, Optional AutoConnect As Boolean = True) As Connection
```
``````

<br/>

**Examples**

Following section demonstrates how to create a connection as **`ImmediatelyConnect`**.
``````XXX
```C#
// Connection is being initialized and opened immediately.
var cn = ms_db.CreateAndOpen();
```
```VB
' Connection is being initialized and opened immediately.
Dim cn = ms_db.CreateAndOpen()
```
``````

<br/>

Following section demonstrates how to create a connection as **`AutoConnection`**.
``````XXX
```C#
// Connection is being initialized.
var cn = ms_db.Create();

// Connection is opened for first execution.
   ...
```
```VB
' Connection is being initialized.
Dim cn = ms_db.Create()

' Connection is opened for first execution.
   ...
```
``````

<br/>

Following section demonstrates how to create a connection as **`AutoConnection`**.
``````XXX
```C#
// Connection is being initialized.
var cn = ms_db.Create(AutoConnect:false);

// Connection is NOT opened for first execution; must be opened manually.
cn.Open();
```
```VB
' Connection is being initialized.
Dim cn = ms_db.Create(AutoConnect:=false)

' Connection is NOT opened for first execution; must be opened manually.
cn.Open()
```
``````

<br/>

Following section demonstrates how to create a connection as **`AutoTrans`**. Please refer to [Transaction](##CON-Transaction) for further information.

``````XXX
```C#
// Initialize transaction automatically on every Commit and Roolback.
var cn = ms_db.Create(AutoTrans:false);
```
```VB
' Initialize transaction automatically on every Commit and Roolback.
Dim cn = ms_db.Create(AutoTrans:=false)
```
``````

<br/>

This means that each time a transaction is committed or rolled-back, a new transaction is started and all queries are automatically executed in this transaction.
