Import data is used for transferring records from one connection to another.

There are several ways to import data to database. Some methods let you import data in a single step directly from **`Source Connection`**; other methods require you to read your data as **`Query`** before you can import it.

**Definition**
``````XXX
```C#
namespace Connection {
    public class Connection {

        public void ImportData(string TableName,
                               Connection SourceConnection,
                               ImportDataCalback CallBack = null,
                               int BatchSize = 1000,
                               bool TruncateBefore = true){}

        public void ImportData(string TableName,
                               DbDataReader Reader,
                               ImportDataCalback CallBack = null,
                               int BatchSize = 1000,
                               bool TruncateBefore = true){}
```
```VB
NameSpace Connection
    Public Class Manager

        Public Shared Sub ImportData(TableName As String,
									 SourceConnection As Connection,
									 CallBack As ImportDataCalback = Nothing,
									 BatchSize As Integer= 1000,
									 TruncateBefore As Boolean = True)

        Public Shared Sub ImportData(TableName As String,
									 Reader As DbDataReader,
									 CallBack As ImportDataCalback= Nothing,
									 BatchSize As Integer= 1000,
									 TruncateBefore As Boolean = True)
```

**Examples**

>Examples shown below needs the [Example Header](##OTH-Example-Header).

Following section demonstrates importing data in table(h) from one connection to another.
``````XXX
```C#
// cn1 : Target connection.
// cn2 : Source connection which has the data.

cn1.ImportData(TableName: h.Name, 
               SourceConnection: cn2 , 
               CallBack: (string TableName, string Message, long Count, long TotalCount) =>
               {
                   if (Count == (long)0)
                       Debug.WriteLine($"{TableName} ==> {Message}");
                   else
                       Debug.WriteLine($"{Message} ==> Import={Count}, Total={TotalCount}");
               });
```
```VB
' cn1 : Target connection.
' cn2 : Source connection which has the data.

cn1.ImportData(TableName:= h.Name, 
               SourceConnection:= cn2, 
               CallBack:=Sub(TableName As String, Message As String, Count As Long, TotalCount As Long)
                   If (Count = 0L) Then
                       Debug.WriteLine($"{TableName} ==> {Message}")
                   Else
                       Debug.WriteLine($"{Message} ==> Import={Count}, Total={TotalCount}")
					End If
               End Sub)
```
