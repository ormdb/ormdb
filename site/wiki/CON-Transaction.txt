**`Transaction`** methods are used with the connection object to save or cancel changes made to the data source.

### BeginTrans
BeginTrans method starts a new transaction. A Transaction cannot be created , if there is an another transaction already in progress.

```C#
cn.BeginTrans();
```
>This example needs the [Example Header](##OTH-Example-Header).

<br/>

You can set the **`AutoTrans`** property in order to start **`Transaction`** automatically.

```C#
using Odb;

var cn = Connection.Manager.Create("MSSQL", AutoTrans:true);
```
>This example needs the [Example Header](##OTH-Example-Header).

<br/>

This means that each time a transaction is committed or rolled-back, a new transaction is started and all queries are automatically executed in this transaction.


### CommitTrans
CommitTrans method saves all the changes made since the last BeginTrans method call and ends current transaction.

If a **connection** is opened as **`AutoTrans = true`** then each time **`CommitTrans`** method is invoked, a new transaction is created automatically.

```C#
cn.CommitTrans();
```
>This example needs the [Example Header](##OTH-Example-Header).

<br/>

If a **connection** is opened as **`AutoTrans = false`**, you can always start a new transaction as shown below.

```C#
cn.CommitTrans(AutoStartTrans:true);
```
>This example needs the [Example Header](##OTH-Example-Header).

<br/>


### RollbackTrans
RollbackTrans method cancels all changes made since the last BeginTrans method call and ends current transaction.

If a **connection** is opened as **`AutoTrans = true`** , then each time **`RollbackTrans`** method is invoked, a new transaction is created automatically.

```C#
cn.RollbackTrans();
```
>This example needs the [Example Header](##OTH-Example-Header).

<br/>

If a **connection** is opened as **`AutoTrans = false`**, you can always start a new transaction as shown below.

```C#
cn.RollbackTrans(AutoStartTrans:true);
```
