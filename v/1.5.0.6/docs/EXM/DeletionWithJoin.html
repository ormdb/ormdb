Following section demonstrates how to delete from [header-table] records, which contain records that is greater than 3 in [line-table].
<code-tab>
	<pre lang="c#">
		// instance(s) created from definition(s)
		var h = new TableHeader();
		var l = new TableLines();
		
		// query is being prepared
		var sql = SQL.X.Delete(h);
			sql.InnerJoin(l, l.Year == h.Year & l.Id == h.Id );
			sql.Where(l.LineId > 3);
		
		// query is being executed
		sql.ExecuteNonQuery(cn);
	</pre>
	<pre lang="vb">
		' instance(s) created from definition(s)
		Dim h = New TableHeader()
		Dim l = New TableLines()
		
		' query is being prepared
		Dim sql = SQL.X.Delete(h)
			sql.InnerJoin(l, l.Year = h.Year And l.Id = h.Id )
			sql.Where(l.LineId > 3)
		
		' query is being executed
		sql.ExecuteNonQuery(cn)
	</pre>
</code-tab>
