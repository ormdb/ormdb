Following section demonstrates <b>deletion with chunks</b>.
<sample>
    <pre lang="c#">
        var t0 = new Orders();
        var t1 = new OrderDetails();

        // Ids are being obtained for the records to be deleted...
        var _ids = Odb.SQL.Select(x => x.Fields(x[t0.OrderID].DISTINCT()) .From(t0) )
                        .ExecuteReader&lt;string&gt;(cn).ToList();

        // records are being deleted in chunks, by supplying record Id information.
        var _index = 0;
        var _chunk_size = 3000;
        var qry = Odb.SQL.Query();
        do {
            var _items = _ids.Skip(_index).Take(_chunk_size);
            If (_items.Count = 0) break;

            // command are being queued
            qry.Delete(x => x.From(t1).Where(t1.OrderID.IN(_items)) );
            qry.Delete(x => x.From(t0).Where(t0.OrderID.IN(_items)) );

            qry.Execute(cn);                // queries are being executed
            qry.Clear();                    // buffer is being clear

            _index += _chunk_size;
        }

        var affectedRows = sql.ExecuteNonQuery(cn);
    </pre>

        <k>Delete</k> operation is always a problem for the large records. But you can break the large delete operation into chunks.
