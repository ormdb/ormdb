Following section demonstrates the dynamic creation of the <hl>Where</hl> clause by <b>depending on conditional (if)</b>.
<sample>
	<pre lang="c#">
        // Define an alias for the models, to use in queries.
        var t0 = new Orders().AsQueryable();
		
		var sql = Odb.SQL.Select(x => 
							x.From(t0)
							  .Where( t0.OrderID == 123456 ) );

		// [Where] clause is being extended depending on IF()
		int _shipper_id = 998877;
		if ( _shipper_id > 0 )
			sql.Add(x => x.Where(t0.ShipperID == _shipper_id));
    </pre>
    <output>
        SELECT * <br />
        FROM [Orders] AS t0 <br />
        WHERE t0.OrderID = 123456<br />
        <hlb> AND t0.ShipperID = 998877</hlb>
    </output>

Following section demonstrates the dynamic creation of the <hl>Where</hl> clause by <b>external variable(s)</b>.
<sample>
	<pre lang="c#">
        // Define an alias for the models, to use in queries.
        var t0 = new Orders().AsQueryable();

		var typ = "C";
		var c_id = 5555;
		var e_id = 6666;

		// [Where] clause is being executed depending on value test.
		Odb.SQL.Select(x => 
						x.From(t0)
							.Where( (typ == "C" & t0.CustomerID == c_id) |
									(typ == "E" & t0.EmployeeID == e_id)
								)
				);
    </pre>
	<output>
		SELECT *<br />
