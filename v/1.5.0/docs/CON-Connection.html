The Connection Object is handling the part of physical communication between the application and the Data Source.

The Connection Object connect to the specified Data Source and open a connection between the application and the Data Source, depends on the parameter specified in the <k>Connection String</k>.
When the connection is established, SQL Commands will execute with the help of the Connection Object and retrieve or manipulate data in the Data Source.

    Once the Database activity is over; Connection should be closed and release the Data Source resources.

<code-tab>
    <pre lang="c#">

This means that each time a transaction is committed or rolled-back, a new transaction is started and all queries are automatically executed in this transaction.
