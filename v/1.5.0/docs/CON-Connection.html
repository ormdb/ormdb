The Connection Object is a part of <k>OrmDb</k> Data Provider and it is a unique session with the Data Source.
The Connection Object is Handling the part of physical communication between the application and the Data Source.
<br />
<br />
The Connection Object connect to the specified Data Source and open a connection between the application and the Data Source, depends on the parameter specified in the <k>Connection String</k>.
When the connection is established, SQL Commands will execute with the help of the Connection Object and retrieve or manipulate data in the Data Source.
<br />
<br />
<co type="warning">
    Once the Database activity is over; Connection should be closed and release the Data Source resources.

Following section demonstrates how to create a connection with <k>DefaultSettings</k>.
<code-tab>
    <pre lang="c#">
        var cn = Odb.Connection.Create&lt;Providers.MsSql&gt;("Your-ConnectionString");

        // Connection, will opened at first execution automatically.

        // You can open the connection manually as shown below.

        ' You can open the connection manually as shown below.
        ' cn.Open()
    </pre>
</code-tab>


<br />
Following section demonstrates how to create a connection with <k>AutoTrans</k>. Please refer to <a href="##CON-Transaction">Transaction</a> for further information.
<code-tab>
    <pre lang="c#">
        var cn = var cn = Odb.Connection.Create&lt;Providers.MsSql&gt;("Your-ConnectionString", new ConnectionSettings() { AutoStartTrans = true });
    </pre>

        Dim cn = Odb.Connection.Create(Of Providers.MsSql)("Your-ConnectionString", New ConnectionSettings() With {.AutoStartTrans = True})
    </pre>
</code-tab>
This means that each time a transaction is committed or rolled-back, a new transaction is started and all queries are automatically executed in this transaction.
